I've been doing sysadmin/managerial work for about 7 years now and have always had a curiosity about the infosec side of my jobs. About 2 years ago, I took on an IT management role and figured that was where I would be gearing my skills towards. Because of my combined sysadmin/management experience, I snagged the role of the IT/IS Officer at a small local bank. This position is what got me looking into the vast domain that is Information Security.

So here I am, about 9 months later trying to break into strictly doing infosec work. The long term goal is Red Team but my current skill set is mostly geared towards compliance and auditing, so I'm now honing my infosec skills. This site is going to serve more of a landing page for my projects and anything tech/security realted I feel like sharing.
